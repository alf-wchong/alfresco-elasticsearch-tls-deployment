# Sample Deployment for Alfresco with Search Enterprise 3 (Elasticsearch) using Basic Auth and TLS

From ACS 7.1 two Search Engines are available:

* [Search Services 1.x and 2.x](https://docs.alfresco.com/search-services/latest/), that relies on a customization of [Apache SOLR 6.6](https://solr.apache.org/guide/6_6/)
* [Search Enterprise 3.x](https://docs.alfresco.com/search-enterprise/latest/), that is a standard client for [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/index.html)

This project provides a *sample* Docker Compose template for ACS 7.2 with Alfresco Search Enterprise 3.1.0 using Basic Auth and TLS to communicate with Elasticsearch. Note that deploying the product in *production* environments would require additional configuration.

Docker Images from [quay.io](https://quay.io/organization/alfresco) are used, since this product is only available for Alfresco Enterprise customers. If you are Enterprise Customer or Partner but you are still experimenting problems to download Docker Images, contact [Alfresco Hyland Support](https://community.hyland.com) in order to get required credentials and permissions.

This project provides different sample projects to support this configuration:

* [local-deployment](local-deployment) folder contains Docker Compose template to deploy every service locally
* [aws-opensearch](aws-opensearch) folder contains Docker Compose template with ACS Services connecting to OpenSearch managed service deployed in AWS
